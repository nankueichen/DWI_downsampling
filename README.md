# A software procedure for guiding and evaluating diffusion MRI down-sampling schemes

* Here we report 1) a post-processing software procedure for down-sampling diffusion MRI for harmonizing data obtained with two different protocols (with the same b value but different numbers of diffusion gradient directions), and 2) a spatial uniformity index of diffusion encoding directions, aiming to predict the quality of the chosen down-sampling schemes. 

* The details of the methods are discussed in our journal paper authored by Nan-kuei Chen, Ryan P. Bell, and Christina S. Meade

* The matlab code is "main.m"
